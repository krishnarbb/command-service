cmd-proxy service is a proxy service which forwards calls to cmd-service for processing the request.

The input for the cmd-proxy service is defined using a Job.
The result of the Job execution is provided by JobResult.

Job is defined in Json notation as :
'{
  "task" : "<task name>", 
  "payload" : "<payload used by the task>"
}'

The result of executing the Job is defined in Json as follows :
'{
  "task" : "<task name>", 
  "payload" : "<payload used by the task>"
  "result" : "result value"
}'

Business rules : 
Currently only the following are supported
task :  add | multiply
payload : two numbers which are comma separated.

Example of Job : 
'{"task":"add", "payload":"1.1,2.1"}'

The Output of the above job on successful execution is :
'{"task":"add", "payload":"1.1,2.1", "result" : "3.2"}'
